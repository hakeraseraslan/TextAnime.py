The "License" section mentions that the project is licensed under the MIT License, which is a common open-source license. You can change the license type if you have specific licensing requirements.

Additionally, it includes a "Copyright" section indicating that the repository and its contents are protected by copyright law. You can customize this section further with your specific copyright information.

Remember that if you want to assert copyright, it's a good practice to specify the license terms under which others can use, modify, and distribute your code. The MIT License is a permissive license, but you can choose a different license that aligns with your preferences.
